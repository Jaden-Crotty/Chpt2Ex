# We need to write a code that always the user to enter his or her height. 

# In[1]:


# Prompt the user to enter their height
height = input("Please enter your height ")

# Enter a print function to allow user to type in height 
print(f"Your height is {height} ")


# ## I tested the function by typing in a hieght and the fuction was sucessful

# ##### we are asked to calculate the distance for a car will travel going 70 miles per hour 
# ##### we need to find the distance the car will travel for diffrent amounts of hours the car will drive 
# ##### This is assuming there are no accidents or delays when traveling

# In[3]:


# Speed of car in miles per hour 
speed = 70

# Time in hours 
time = (input("Enter times in hours: "))

# to calculate distance 
distance = speed * time 

print (f"The car travels {distance} miles in {time} hours")

# I am predicting that this will allow me to type in the time in hours to find the distance
