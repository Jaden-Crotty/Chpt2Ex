# We need to write a code that always the user to enter his or her height. 

# In[1]:


# Prompt the user to enter their height
height = input("Please enter your height ")

# Enter a print function to allow user to type in height 
print(f"Your height is {height} ")


# ## I tested the function by typing in a hieght and the fuction was sucessful

# ##### we are asked to calculate the distance for a car will travel going 70 miles per hour 
# ##### we need to find the distance the car will travel for diffrent amounts of hours the car will drive 
# ##### This is assuming there are no accidents or delays when traveling

# In[5]:


# Speed of car in miles per hour 
speed = 70

# Time in hours 
time = (input("Enter times in hours: "))

# to calculate distance 
distance = speed * time 

print (f"The car travels {distance} miles in {time} hours")

# I am predicting that this will allow me to type in the time in hours to find the distance 

# after running a test the formal didnt work 
# be bellive the speed didnt enter the equation for some reason  


# In[6]:


# Speed of the car in miles per hour
speed = 70

# Time in hours
time = float(input("Enter the time in hours: "))

# Calculate the distance using the formula: distance = speed * time
distance = speed * time

# Display the calculated distance
print(f"The car travels {distance} miles in {time} hours.")


# In[7]:


# Speed of the car in miles per hour
speed = 70

# Time in hours
time = float(input("Enter the time in hours: "))

# Calculate the distance using the formula: distance = speed * time
distance = speed * time

# Display the calculated distance
print(f"The car travels {distance} miles in {time} hours.")


# In[8]:


# Speed of the car in miles per hour
speed = 70

# Time in hours
time = float(input("Enter the time in hours: "))

# Calculate the distance using the formula: distance = speed * time
distance = speed * time

# Display the calculated distance
print(f"The car travels {distance} miles in {time} hours.")


# ##### after looking at section 2.6 in the book I found that I needed to added the int or float fuction for the value to be read as a math equation 
# ##### my perdiction was wrong with the speed not being added into the equation then i starteded looking in the book and quickly found my problem
